These line-transect surveys, conducted aboard NOAA research vessels (David Starr Jordan, McArthur, McArthur II, Reuben Lasker, Bell M. Shimada), typically occur in summer and fall and span waters out 300 nautical miles offshore, from the US-Canada to US-Mexico border, but sometimes include waters in Canada or Mexico as well. Data types collected principally include visual sightings data for cetaceans and seabirds, passive acoustic (e.g., towed or drifting array) data for cetaceans, tissue biopsy sampling used for genetics analysis, and oceanographic sampling. Survey data have been used to estimate cetacean population size and trends, delineate cetacean population stock structure, describe cetacean and seabird distributions and hotspots, develop species distribution models, and inform marine mammal stock assessment reports pursuant to statutory requirements under the MMPA.\nLink to our Website with more information",

Our scientists develop species distribution models for cetaceans, based on the Marine Mammal and Turtle Division’s extensive line-transect survey data collected in the Pacific Ocean since the mid-1980s. The resulting model predictions are used by scientists, managers and other federal agencies to assess and mitigate potential impacts to cetaceans from a wide range of human activities.",

    "text": "CMAP Team: How to Backup Your Brain\nWe have two steps to backing up our brain: (1) Backup data/info to an external hard drive and (2) Backup information to Github (including this site). This Lab Manual will serve as a ‘field guide to our brains’, and will include a summary of all data/projects/SOP/manuals/etc as well as links or paths to more information. Kourtney and Shannon are here to help! Below are the initial steps:\n\nHard Drive Backup\nWe have set up a hard drive (20Tb) set up to a computer (SWC-SWEAV-D) and each team member will have their own folder. We ask that you create folders for each group of materials/topic. Within each folder there should be a ‘readme’ text file with a basic summary of what is in that folder. When you are ready to backup your data, reach out directly to Kourtney at kourtney.burger@noaa.gov.\n\n\nCMAP Github Organization and Lab Manual\nThe Lab Manual will serve as the initial ‘go to’ place for any/all information. For each topic, we have a section (see left sidebar), and we have an additional section for other random projects. Do you need extra Topic Headings? Let us know! To have content added, you can either do it yourself, or ask us for help. Below are intro instructions for either approach.\n\nGet Help!\nYou can either email Shannon to get you started, or send us info for each topic following these methods:\n\nFor each topic, prepare content in format that works for you.\n\nCreate a project summary\nAdd other information (as a word doc or similar). Ok to add pictures, etc. We can also do tables.\nIdentify all links, pathways (if not online), etc.\n\nIf there is any component of this project that you would like to make publicly available, let us know more about this data/code/info (file types, # files, total size of info, is there any PII?). We can help make this publicly available for you.\nWhen all info is complied, Go to the webpage for that topic, and on the right hand side of the page, click on the “Report an Issue”. Let us know the topic name, and provide us with all the info you have. On the right hand side, assign to Shannon, Kourtney, and yourself (if you can).\nDo this for each ‘Topic’ you have, including any side projects (give us a new topic name, and state that they are side projects!). We’ll Reach out with any questions!\n\n\n\nDo it Yourself!\nIf you know how to modify the documents, feel free to do so yourself! Here is a link to more information on these types of Lab Manuals, including how to modify info yourself. There is a ‘supplemental’ folder for any additional documents, direct link images go in the content/images folder, and if you have individual code/rmd docs, you can add them to the ‘code’ folder.\nIf you want to add extra projects, there are instructions on the Projects Page.\nIf you need to make additional repositories for specific projects, feel free to use our github templates to create a Lab Manual-style Repo (with a website like this!) or our Research Compendium template(these set you up with less work!). Instructions are provided in the links.\nOnce you are done, please add an issue, assign to Kourtney/Shannon, and ask us to check it (and also let us know if there are any things you need added, or if you need us to put in links to your other docs).\nAs always, reach out if you need help!",
