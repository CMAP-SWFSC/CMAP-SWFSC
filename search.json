These line-transect surveys, conducted aboard NOAA research vessels (David Starr Jordan, McArthur, McArthur II, Reuben Lasker, Bell M. Shimada), typically occur in summer and fall and span waters out 300 nautical miles offshore, from the US-Canada to US-Mexico border, but sometimes include waters in Canada or Mexico as well. Data types collected principally include visual sightings data for cetaceans and seabirds, passive acoustic (e.g., towed or drifting array) data for cetaceans, tissue biopsy sampling used for genetics analysis, and oceanographic sampling. Survey data have been used to estimate cetacean population size and trends, delineate cetacean population stock structure, describe cetacean and seabird distributions and hotspots, develop species distribution models, and inform marine mammal stock assessment reports pursuant to statutory requirements under the MMPA.\nLink to our Website with more information",

    "text": "CMAP Team: How to Backup Your Brain\nWe have two steps to backing up our brain: (1) Backup data/info to an external hard drive and (2) Backup information to Github (including this site). This Lab Manual will serve as a ‘field guide to our brains’, and will include a summary of all data/projects/SOP/manuals/etc as well as links or paths to more information. Kourtney and Shannon are here to help! Below are the initial steps:\n\nHard Drive Backup\nWe have set up a hard drive (20Tb) set up to a computer (SWC-SWEAV-D) and each team member will have their own folder. We ask that you create folders for each group of materials/topic. Within each folder there should be a ‘readme’ text file with a basic summary of what is in that folder. When you are ready to backup your data, reach out directly to Kourtney at kourtney.burger@noaa.gov.\n\n\nCMAP Github Organization and Lab Manual\nThe Lab Manual will serve as the initial ‘go to’ place for any/all information. For each topic, we have a section (see left sidebar), and we have an additional section for other random projects. Do you need extra Topic Headings? Let us know! To have content added, you can either do it yourself, or ask us for help. Below are intro instructions for either approach.\n\nGet Help!\nYou can either email Shannon to get you started, or send us info for each topic following these methods:\n\nPrep Material. For each topic, prepare content in format that works for you.\n\nCreate a project summary\nAdd other information (as a word doc or similar). Ok to add pictures, etc. We can also do tables.\nIdentify all links, pathways (if not online), etc. This can include where this information is stored on the CMAP External Hard drive (the one we are now building).\n\nIdentify info for Public Accessibility. If there is any component of this project that you would like to make publicly available, let us know more about this data/code/info (file types, # files, total size of info, is there any PII?). We can help make this publicly available for you.\nCreate a Github Issue. When all info is complied, Go to the webpage for that topic and create an issue.\n\nFrom that specific topic webpage, go to the right hand side of the page, click on the “Report an Issue”. Select the green New Issue button (on the right)\nCreate a concise but informative title.\nWrite a detailed description and include as much info as you can (if this info is saved on a document file, then point us to that document). Provide as much info as you can– what you want on the page itself, links to what is already publicly available, what you want made publicly available, and what you want to retain privately but provide a pathway/link.\nAssign this issue to Shannon, Kourtney, and yourself (if you can). Here is more info on creating an issue.\n\nRinse, Repeat. Do this for each ‘Topic’ you have, including any side projects (give us a new topic name, and state that they are side projects!). We’ll Reach out with any questions!\n\n\n\nDo it Yourself!\nIf you want to do it yourself, go for it! If you need to learn, we are happy to help you through it. Here is a basic outline to follow (with links for more info).\n\nGet Local Access to Repo. Use Github Desktop and RStudio to get local access to the CMAP-SWFSC repo. Instructions Link (after you make sure you have the appropriate software, skip down to Clone Repo to Local Computer).\nCreate and Modify Content. Instructions provided here.\nSave ancillary documents. If you have documents (not big file size) that you want to save directly to this Repo, save them in the ‘supplemental’ folder. To add a link in your webpage file (quarto do), use this format: https://github.com/CMAP-SWFSC/CMAP-SWFSC/tree/main/supplement/xxx (where xxx is your file name with extension).\nSave related code. If you have code or rMarkdown docs (not huge) that you want to save directly to the Repo, save them in the ‘code’ folder. To add a link in your webpage file (quarto do), use this format: https://github.com/CMAP-SWFSC/CMAP-SWFSC/tree/main/code/xxx (where xxx is your file name with extension).\nAdd Smaller Projects. If you want to add smaller projects (not the bigger topics, there are instructions on the Projects Page.\nPush changes to Github. When you are finished working on it for the moment, commit & save to github following these instructions.\n\nIf you need to make additional repositories for specific projects, feel free to use our github templates to create a Lab Manual-style Repo (with a website like this!) or our Research Compendium template(these set you up with less work!). Instructions are provided in the links.\nOnce you are done, please add an issue, assign to Kourtney/Shannon, and ask us to check it (and also let us know if there are any things you need added, or if you need us to put in links to your other docs).\nAs always, reach out if you need help!",
