To generate an annual report, you will use R scripts and an R Markdown file housed in the SWFSC/MSI-report repository (accessible to all NOAA Github Enterprise users) to produce an automated report based on the HCMSI_Records_SWFSC_Main.xlsx file. Detailed instructions are provided within the SWFSC/MSI-report repository, and include these main steps:\n\nRun ‘SeriousInjuryExtract.R’ to data mine HCMSI_Records_SWFSC_Main.xlsx. Running this script produces an RData file, which interacts with the steps 2 and 3.\nRun ‘AppendixTable.R’ to produce Appendix 1 as a DOCX file for the report.\nRun R Markdown file ‘HCM_SI_Report.Rmd’ to produce the main body of the annual report as a DOCX file, which is edited for format and collated with Appendix 1 for publication.",

For the majority of the time series, the ground surveys have been quarterly and have included all life stages. Since 2019, only pups have been routinely counted, and only during the respective breeding seasons for CSL (July-August) and NES (January-February). Counts of CSL pups from this southernmost rookery for the U.S. stock provide complementary and often contrasting information with trends at other rookeries to the north. The NES rookery is very small and may provide little ecological insight.\nData from these surveys are available on GitHub (access restricted) and forked to the SWFSC GitHub Enterprise organization.",

    "text": "ObsCovgTools\nAssessing the potential risk of fisheries to marine wildlife populations may include an evaluation of observer coverage in terms of how well it documents bycatch of a species of conservation concern (Curtis and Carretta, 2020). The R package ObsCovgTools (Curtis, 2020) provides utilities for evaluating observer coverage with respect to documenting and estimating rare bycatch, including (1) probabilities of observing a bycatch event and of one occurring in total effort, (2) upper confidence limit for bycatch given none was observed, and (3) bycatch estimation CV (coefficient of variation). This tool has generated wide interest, including from ICES, IATTC, MSC, and NOPAT.\nThe package includes a Shiny web application that is served on the NMFS Posit Connect server at https://connect.fisheries.noaa.gov/ObsCovg/ (which requires a Posit Connect account). Login to Posit Connect (via single sign-on) provides access to a dashboard with usage statistics and settings for the app deployment. The package version served on Posit Connect must have been built in one of the R versions available on the server. If a Shiny app is no longer working on the Posit Connect server, one of the administrators will typically notify the maintainer of the app, who will need to update the package build to a newer version of R, or otherwise troubleshoot it as needed, and then redeploy it on the server. Resources for Posit Connect users include NMFS-generated FAQs and a Posit Connect demo video. Contacts who may be able to provide help with setting up a Posit Connect account and redeploying an app include Kathryn Doering (kathryn.doering@noaa.gov, SWFSC), Sam Woodman (sam.woodman@noaa.gov, SWFSC), and Christine Stawitz (christine.stawitz@noaa.gov, OST).\nThe ObsCovgTools repository has also been forked to the SWFSC GitHub Enterprise organization.\n\nReferences\nCurtis K.

Abundance estimates for the U.S. West Coast as a whole are similar between mark-recapture estimates, which are based on photo-ID data from California and Oregon, and estimates from species distribution models using data from ship-based surveys of U.S. waters off California, Oregon, and Washington (Becker et al., 2020; Calambokidis and Barlow, 2020). Curtis et al. (2022) estimated abundance for the CentAm/SMex-CA/OR/WA stock from wintering area photo-ID data collected during 2019-2021, corrected for negative bias due to sex heterogeneity. They also estimated the MMex-CA/OR/WA stock size by subtraction from the most recent estimate by Calambokidis and Barlow (2020).\nThe version of the CAPTURE program used by Barlow and Calambokidis (2020) to estimate abundance using a Chao Mth model, and a function for running it, are available in the R package CMRutils available on GitHub, which has been forked to the SWFSC GitHub Enterprise organization.\n\n2022 estimate data:\n\nR code for these estimates is available in the CASM-Mn-abundance-2022 repository on GitHub, which has been forked to the SWFSC GitHub Enterprise organization.\nMCMC results for these estimates and for related analyses are available at ‘SWFSC-MMTD-CMAP://Alex Curtis/Humpbacks/results/Curtis et al 2022 and related exploration/’\nThe version of the CRC MN ID database on which these estimates are based is available at ‘SWFSC-MMTD-CMAP://Alex Curtis/Humpbacks/data/MN ID 20210831.mdb’.\n\nAssessment update:\n\nPreliminary MCMC results updating these estimates through 2022 are at ‘SWFSC-MMTD-CMAP://Alex Curtis/Humpbacks/results/updating Central America assessment/’.\nR code updating data import and filtering to current standards and data is in a private GitHub repository that has been forked to the SWFSC GitHub Enterprise organization, with read permission for Jeff Moore.\nNotes on a work plan to update the stock abundance estimates through 2024 are in a private GitHub project that has been copied to the SWFSC GitHub Enterprise organization, with read permission for Jeff Moore.\nThe most recently acquired version of the CRC MN ID database, which is being used to develop new estimates, is available at ‘SWFSC-MMTD-CMAP://Alex Curtis/Humpbacks/data/’MN ID 20250313.zip/MN ID.mdb’.\n\n\n\nReferences\nBecker, E.A., Forney, K.A., Miller, D.L., Fiedler, P.C., Barlow, J., Moore, J.E. 2020.
