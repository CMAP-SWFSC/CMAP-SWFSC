### Marine Mammal Stock Assessments (SARS) 

Marine Mammal Stock Assessments (SARS) Locations: “C:\Carretta\Stock Assessment
Reports (SARS)\Current SAR Word Files” Also check for files in the Sar2024 and
Sar2025 folders of the main SARS directory, as draft 2024 SARs were released for
public comment in February of 2025, and draft 2025 SARS are being reviewed by
the PSRG in April 2025. The Pacific Islands Science Center will have the
most-recent versions of their reports, if you need to locate the latest version
being prepared for SRG review and public comment. An overview of all Pacific
SARS that show the current and proposed revision status is included in a Word
doc titled “SAR Summary Table 2025 Draft SARs.docx” as of this writing in April
2025. It is also found in the ‘Current SAR Word Files’ folder. The SAR editor
should read and be familiar with the Guidelines for Preparing Marine Mammal
Stock Assessments (NMFS 2023) and section 117 of the Marine Mammal Protection
Act. Other than those two documents, keeping up with the marine mammal
literature is probably one of the more difficult parts of the job. The editor is
also responsible for drafting and coordinating responses to public comments on
draft SARS. The Pacific Region SARs are written by 4 separate laboratories:
SWFSC, NWFSC (Southern Resident Killer Whale = Brad Hanson), AKFSC (several
pinniped reports = Sharon Melin), and PIFSC (Amanda Bradford). The Pacific SAR
editor coordinates the annual revision of reports, along with the Office of
Protected Resources (OPR review of draft and final reports). Responsibility for
archiving the most-recent versions of individual SAR files ultimately rests with
the authors of the individual SARs, for example, PIFSC maintains its own files.
It is probably good practice for the next SAR editor to try to mirror all
up-to-date SAR files in a single place though. If a Word file is lost or
corrupted, a PDF to Word conversion (using the online versions of published
SARs) is useful for reconstruction. Prepare draft SARs each fall / winter in
preparation for the winter / spring Pacific Scientific Review Group meeting.
Draft SARs are submitted to the SRG liaison (Laura.McCue\@noaa.gov PIFSC) 6
weeks before the meeting, so that 1) OPR can have 3 weeks to review them for
issues and 2) the SRG liaison can send them to the Pacific Scientific Review
Group (PSRG) 3 weeks before the meeting. Post-meeting, draft SARs are further
revised, based on comments received. By summer, draft SARs are usually published
in the Federal Register for a 90-day public comment period. The SAR annual cycle
has taken a year to complete in recent years. For example, the 2024 draft SARs
were just released for public comment in March 2025, during the same time that
we were submitting draft 2025 SARs to the PSRG. This overlap makes the SAR
editor task more difficult, as it means multiple ‘draft’ versions of the same
SAR may exist at one time (e.g., there are currently two versions of the
Southern Resident Killer Whale SAR (draft 2024 in public comment and draft 2025
submitted for PSRG review). Ideally, the final 2024 version should have been
published prior to drafting a 2025 report. This necessitates accepting changes
to the draft 2024 version to use as a template for the 2025 report, not a good
situation. A variety of techniques are being used to revise the reports
annually, from the simplest (Word markup and track changes, SWFSC), to more
complex R-based revision, using Quarto or Markdown (MML, PIFSC). Common to all
approaches is the requirement to show transparent revisions for the regional
Scientific Review Groups and the public to assess. Some examples of how actual
revisions should appear are shown in Figure 1. List of current SAR personnel and
roles Jim.Carretta\@noaa.gov (Writes, edits, coordinates the production of SARs
from multiple Science Centers. Sometimes responsible for ensuring that final
SARs are 508 compliant for posting on websites. Otherwise, someone in the
publications division (formerly Kit.Johnston\@noaa.gov, retired) who deals with
Technical Memoranda should help with this. Compliant documents need to be sent
to the NOAA Institutional Repository to be checked prior to publication.
Eric.Patterson\@noaa.gov, Kristy.Long\@noaa.gov, Megan.Wallen\@noaa.gov
(National review of draft and final SARs prior to release for SRG review /
public comment, and final publication). Zachary.Schackner\@noaa.gov (Federal
Register coordination and review of SARs for release as drafts and 90-day public
comment period). Laura.McCue\@noaa.gov (Pacific SRG liaison. Draft SARs sent to
her at least 3 weeks before an SRG meeting for distribution to the group.)
Justin.Greenman\@noaa.gov, Lauren.Saez\@noaa.gov : they provide annual
information on the human-caused mortality and serious injury cases that feed
into the SAR revision process.
