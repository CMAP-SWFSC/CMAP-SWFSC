## Primary home

The new home for MMPA Implementation work writ large (MSI data and reports, bycatch estimation and reports, coordination, etc) is under construction under the umbrella of the [SWFSC GitHub Enterprise organization MMPA-Implementation team](https://github.com/orgs/SWFSC/teams/mmpa-implementation). The CMAP lab manual, including this page, will be updated as a central landing page for this work, with relevant information and links as they evolve.

## Location of Carretta's files (laptop + backups)

In addition to pages on the CMAP Github, I've written a general guide [**MMPA Implementation Carretta.docx**](https://github.com/CMAP-SWFSC/CMAP-SWFSC/blob/main/content/MMPA%20Implementation%20CARRETTA.docx). The doc is also located in the directory shown below. Content on several of these CMAP pages attempts to mirror the Word document.
