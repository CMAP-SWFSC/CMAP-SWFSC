## Background
Our program conducts ship-, aerial-, and land-based surveys of marine mammals throughout the California Current large marine ecosystem. Large-vessel line-transect cetacean surveys have been conducted since 1991, with recent surveys supported through the PacMAPPS Initiative. Aerial surveys are conducted for harbor porpoises and pinnipeds. Shore-based surveys are conducted for gray whales, led by the Cetacean Health and Life History Program.
