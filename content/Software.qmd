## Generating transects using R-Package 'atm'

Kevin Stierhoff provided us with R-code from the ['atm' package](https://github.com/SWFSC/atm) used to generate a transect grid for the 2024 CalCurCEAS survey. These transects were then incorporated into [CalTopo](https://caltopo.com/about/) for planning and to track cruise progress. The package files are also included on the SWFSC-CMAP Lab Manual Github site in the [code folder](https://github.com/CMAP-SWFSC/CMAP-SWFSC/tree/main/_code).

Open the MMTD Survey Planner R-Project in RStudio

Then go to the 'doc' folder and open the MMTD_Survey_Planner.RMD file. Learn the code, make adjustments to transect spacing, and 'knit' the file to create transect lines.

The R-markdown file will generate a series of plots, corresponding to sections of the code: ![](images/MMTD_Survey_Planner_Base_Map1.PNG){width="900"} ![](images/MMTD_Survey_Planner_Base_Map2.PNG){width="900"} ... including an interactive Leaflet map: ![](images/MMTD_Survey_Planner_Leaflet_map.PNG){width="900"}

## Mapping and Summarizing line-transect survey DAS data

Our research cruises utilize the software VisCruz to collect data in the data acquisition system? (DAS) format. DAS data can be error-checked, processed, and tabulated using Sam Woodman's R-Package [swfscDAS](https://github.com/SWFSC/swfscDAS)

The swfscDAS package is intended to standardize and streamline basic DAS data processing. Functionality currently includes reading DAS data into a data frame, processing this data (extracting state and condition information for each DAS event), and summarizing sighting, effort, and comment information. Learn more in vignette("swfscDAS")

Effort and Sighting Maps can be generated using the R-package [CruzPlot](https://github.com/SWFSC/CruzPlot). CruzPlot contains a GUI for creating maps, plotting data, and performing basic data summaries from data files in the “DAS” format, produced by the SWFSC software WinCruz and VisCruz. Fancier JPG maps for Marine Mammal Stock Assessments (U.S. West Coast only) can be generated using the R-script [Plot_DAS Effort_and_Sightings_Data_SARS.R](https://github.com/CMAP-SWFSC/CMAP-SWFSC/tree/main/_code)

Another useful script interacts with the R-Package swfscDAS and a DAS file to produce a tabular, CSV format summary of all sightings data: "get_Sightings_swfscDAS.R" This script is in the "c:/carretta/cruise_1652/R_utilities" directory. You can also just read the swfscDAS documentation to do the same thing.
