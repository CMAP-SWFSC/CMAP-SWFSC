## Background

Since 1991, the Marine Mammal and Turtle Division (MMTD), previously the Protected Resources Division (PRD), has conducted large-vessel cetacean and ecosystem assessment surveys in waters off the U.S. West Coast. These line-transect surveys, conducted aboard NOAA research vessels (David Starr Jordan, McArthur, McArthur II, Reuben Lasker, Bell M. Shimada), typically occur in summer and fall and span waters out 300 nautical miles offshore, from the US-Canada to US-Mexico border, but sometimes include waters in Canada or Mexico as well. Data types collected principally include visual sightings data for cetaceans and seabirds, passive acoustic (e.g., towed or drifting array) data for cetaceans, tissue biopsy sampling used for genetics analysis, and oceanographic sampling. Survey data have been used to estimate cetacean population size and trends, delineate cetacean population stock structure, describe cetacean and seabird distributions and hotspots, develop species distribution models, and inform marine mammal stock assessment reports pursuant to statutory requirements under the MMPA.

## Line Transect (DAS) Data, R-Code and related physical assets.

In addition to DAS data collected with WinCruz and Viscruz on our surveys, there are binders of sighting forms, observer green books, and microfiche located in Room 263 off the parking garage. We have maxed-out on space, so there is currently overflow from 2018 and 2024 cruises in Room 421 (Carretta). Additionally, we store microfiche data with Corovan offsite, the point of contact is Henry Salazar and email is sdvault\@corodata.com . There are a limited number of cruises that Al Jackson and others scanned the sighting forms for, located on the shared drive swc-storage-4s/LineTransect/Scanning. Below is a screen grab showing which cruise numbers have scanned sighting forms. I did not scan the most-recent 2024 CalCurCEAS cruise (Cruise 1652).

## R-utilities related to cruise data. ![](images/R_utilities.png){width="900"} 

Several R-scripts were developed for the 2024 CalCurCEAS cruise to aid with entering group sizes into DAS files from green books (3 related scripts, appendObserverEstimates.R, misc_DAS_funcs.R, and appendGroupSizes.R, see screen grab above for directory listing). All three scripts are required to interact with a specified DAS file and a CSV file that the user creates to house the daily data for uptake into a specified DAS file. Another useful script is get_Sightings_swfscDAS.R that interacts directly with a DAS file and the R-package swfscDAS to produce a CSV file of all sighting information (see swfscDAS package vignette). There is also a script (DAS_to_JSON.R) used for converting DAS files to JSON (for plotting in CalTopo for example). See the [Software](https://cmap-swfsc.github.io/CMAP-SWFSC/content/Software.html) page for more info.
