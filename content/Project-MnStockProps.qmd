title: Humpback Stock Proportions
---

Curtis et al. (in center review) estimated humpback whale stock proportions for latitude bins along the U.S. West Coast. The R package [`ApportionMnStocks`](https://github.com/kacurtis/ApportionMnStocks), available on GitHub and forked to the SWFSC GHE organization, allows users to estimate stock proportions for a latitude (range) of interest based on these results.
