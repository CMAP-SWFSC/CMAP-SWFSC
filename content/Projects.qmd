## Background

This is a landing page for additional Projects. To add an additional project page, follow these instructions:

1.  Navigate to the CMAP-SWFSC/content folder

2.  Add a new Quarto Document and label it: "Project-xxx", where 'xxx' is an abbreviated name for your project

3.  Add the following to the top of your document (But add a more official project title). You will document your information here (ask for help!)

    ![](images/addProjectPageYml.PNG){width="211"}

4.  Open to the CMAP-SWFSC/quarto.yml, and scroll down to the section that looks like this (section: Project):

![](images/addProject2quartoYml.PNG){width="267"}

-- You will need to add 1 lines to include your project, using the appropriate syntax "content/Project-xxx.qmd"
