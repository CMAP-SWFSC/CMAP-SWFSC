title: Stock Assessments

## Background 
Assessing marine mammal stocks gives us valuable information on population trends, productivity rates, estimates of human-caused mortality and other sources of serious injury, and more. These assessments allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of conservation and recovery measures, and to adjust management approaches as needed. Our program is responsible for producing [annual stock assessments](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-mammal-protection/marine-mammal-stock-assessments) for marine mammal populations inhabiting waters off the U.S. West Coast.
