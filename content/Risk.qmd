title: Population Risk Assessment
---


## Background
Risk refers to the likelihood and severity of negative outcomes (e.g., of an endangered population not recovering). Our scientists conducts analyses to evaluate risks to marine mammal associated with human stressors or environmental change (e.g., [entanglement risk for large whales](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/document/infographic-west-coast-humpback-whale-entanglements)). They communicate risk assessment findings to NOAA managers, and develop tools to help guide decisions for managing risk.

## ObsCovgTools
Assessing the potential risk of fisheries to marine wildlife populations may include an evaluation of observer coverage in terms of how well it documents bycatch of a species of conservation concern. The R package ['ObsCovgTools'](https://github.com/kacurtis/ObsCovgTools/tree/main) (Curtis, 2020) provides utilities for evaluating observer coverage with respect to documenting and estimating rare bycatch, including (1) probabilities of observing a bycatch event and of one occurring in total effort, (2) upper confidence limit for bycatch given none was observed, and (3) bycatch estimation CV (coefficient of variation). Alex Curtis and Jim Carretta published a paper applying this package to a broad suite of protected species bycatch in the California drift gillnet fishery (Curtis and Carretta, 2020).

This package includes a Shiny web application (i.e., a GUI) that is served on the NMFS Posit Connect server at https://connect.fisheries.noaa.gov/ObsCovg/. The package version served on Posit Connect must have been built in one of the R versions available on the server. If a Shiny app is no longer working on the Posit Connect server, one of the administrators will typically notify the maintainer of the app. The maintainer can then update the package build to a newer version of R, or otherwise troubleshoot it as needed, and then redeploy it on the server. Contacts who may be able to provide assistance with this process include Kathryn Doering (kathryn.doering@noaa.gov, SWFSC) and Sam Woodman (sam.woodman@noaa.gov, SWFSC), and Christine Stawitz (christine.stawitz@noaa.gov, OST).
