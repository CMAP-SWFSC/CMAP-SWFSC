title: Otolith Catalog
---

The regional otolith catalog developed by Mark Lowry (Lowry 2011) contains 
relatively low resolution photographs. Original and edited photographs for this 
catalog, of much higher quality, are stored at
SWFSC-MMTD-CMAP://Alex Curtis/Otolith files/ as well as on //swc-storage4-s/scatdb/
(restricted access).
